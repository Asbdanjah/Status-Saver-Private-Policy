  <h1>Status Saver - Privacy Policy & Permissions</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      Status Saver values your privacy. This app does not collect, store, or share any personal information.
      All saved statuses (images and videos) remain on your device and are never uploaded to any server.
    </p>
    <p>
      The app requires certain permissions to function properly, but these are used only for their intended purposes and not for any data collection or tracking.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Advertising:</b> Status Saver displays ads provided by third-party networks (such as Google AdMob).
      These networks may use cookies or unique device identifiers to show you relevant ads, but no personal data is collected by this app.
    </p>
